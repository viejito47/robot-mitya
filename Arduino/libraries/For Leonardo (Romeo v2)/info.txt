You can't use Timer2 (Which used in default IRremote library) for Leonardo (Romeo v2).
So 
1. I changed Timer2 to Timer1 in IRremote library
2. Removed Timer1 use in Servo library (one Timer3 is enough), because they had conflict with IRRemote because of 1.

Servo library given just for option. Don't use it. Use SoftwareServo instead.
