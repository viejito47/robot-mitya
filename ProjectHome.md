My name is Dmitry Dzakhov and this is my non-commercial hobby project. The goal was to make a small home toy-robot with abilities to make my hobby last for years :). The intermediate goal was to take part in a local office robo-war. So I spent two months of nights filled with research, constructing and programming. As a result now I have a 4-wheeled platform with Arduino Uno and some shields and an Android phone that controls Arduino. Above this level I made a .NET XNA application for PC to control robot through Wi-Fi.

Now Mitya (his name is Mitya) is driven, rolling and buzzing. He has a gun :) and it fires! This is an IR-gun and I made an IR-sensor to fix hits if somebody shoots us. I don't like wars and robo-wars, so my future plan is to make Mitya an autonomous toy and distant controlled helper.

I have written some articles about Mitya on http://habrahabr.ru (about [building the robot](http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/135043/), [setting the developer's environment](http://habrahabr.ru/post/139304/) and [transmitting video and audio streams](http://habrahabr.ru/post/144748/)). If you can't read Russian I'm afraid it is not very useful for you :). My Klingon is bad, so I choose Russian. If you decline to learn Russian... well... ok, you can still look at the pictures and links in this article. And I have a couple of videos on my [YouTube-chanel](http://www.youtube.com/user/DmitryDzz/videos) to show you what Mitya is.
